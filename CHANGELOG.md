## [3.77.0] - 2026-07-04
### Added
- **Subsonic API**: Added support for token+salt authentication (legacy Subsonic auth) by using the API key as the secret.
- Modular build system: split `build_and_publish.sh` into `build.sh`, `publish.sh`, and `deploy.sh`.
- Build System: Introduced `debug` (default) and `release` modes in `bup` and deployment scripts, with intelligent tagging (`alpha`, `stable`, `latest`).
- Versioned Docker tagging: images are now tagged with the version from CMake (e.g., `:3.77.0`) plus either `:stable` (if `SERVICE_NAME=lms`) or `:latest` (default).
- Portainer Webhook support for automated deployments.
- Automatic Docker group permission handling using `sg docker` re-execution.
- Standardized `.env` configuration file for deployment settings.
- `bup` shortcut for the full build and publish pipeline.
- Registry authentication pre-check in `publish.sh`.
- **Docker Compose**: Updated `docker-compose.yml` with environment variable support and sensible defaults.
- **Docker Compose**: Removed explicit `container_name` to prevent naming conflicts and support multiple environments.
- **Docker Compose**: Updated `docker-compose.yml` with versioned tags, correct service names (`lms`, `lms_alpha`), and optimized `/mnt/` volume paths.
- **MuMa Spotify**: Added a new release notes modal and version update notification system.
- **MuMa Spotify**: Added a persistent "Release Notes" history in the About section.
- **Branding**: Renamed project to "Lightweight MuMa Server (LMS)" and the web interface to "MuMa Spotify".
- Created `scripts/deploy-stack.sh`, a generalized Docker stack deployment tool supporting Portainer discovery, SSH transfer, and intelligent fallbacks.
- Support for initial stack creation: the deployment script now automatically creates the stack if it does not exist yet using a local template.

### Changed
- Reorganized project structure: moved all utility scripts (`build.sh`, `publish.sh`, `deploy.sh`, `install.sh`, etc.) from root to `scripts/` directory, while maintaining the `bup` shortcut in root.
- Updated `install.sh` to handle `.env` creation and dependency checks automatically.
- Unified deployment environment variables (`REMOTE_STACK_PATH`, `DEPLOY_TARGET_NAME`) for multi-repo consistency.
- **Deployment**: Refactored `deploy.sh` to use the new generalized `deploy-stack.sh` helper, simplifying per-project deployment scripts.
- **Deployment**: Enhanced stack discovery to support `PORTAINER_HOST` for pulling master templates.
- **Deployment**: Improved robustness with `base64` template transfer and automated tab-to-space conversion in compose files.
- **Deployment**: Fixed `.env` parsing to correctly handle trailing comments and whitespace.
- **Branding**: Updated all repository references to `tsshadow/lms` on GitHub and Docker Hub.
- **Internal**: Reverted internal C++ and frontend source naming to "Spotify" for developer readability, while maintaining "MuMa Spotify" branding for user-facing components.

### Fixed
- Fixed "orphan containers" warnings during deployment by adding `--remove-orphans` to the deployment scripts.
- Fixed Docker Hub push denial issues by adding proactive login checks.
- Improved SSH deployment reliability by verifying remote Docker Compose paths.
